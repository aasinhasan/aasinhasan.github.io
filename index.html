								<p><b><u>HCN Team Lead/Sr. Manufacturing Engineer at ASCEND</u></b><br />I manage a core team of operations engineers overseeing every unit within the 2800-acre plant, determining unit production rates depending on customer need, supply chain logistics, SIOP, maintenance schedules, and profitability. Usually, I'll coordinate with my engineers bi-weekly to formulate the overall plan for the plant for the next 72 hours.<br /><br />Senior Manufacturing Engineer supporting day to day operations of the Disodium iminodiacetate (DSIDA) and Nitrilotriacetate (NTA) batch facilities producing the intermediate chemicals to Roundup herbicide.
</p>
								<p><b><u>Projects</u></b><br />&#x2022; Led $10MM total recommissioning of plant including steam, power, auxiliaries, specialty chemicals, and mechanical systems during the 2021 Great Freeze natural disaster wherein worst-case scenario occurred and critical power was lost for several days resulting in 250,000 lbs of sodium cyanide solution frozen in reactor forming solid hydrate. Completely stripped insulation off the 48 ft crystallizer and reboiler circulation loop and thawed out material safely using specially designed heating elements, providing engineering technical expertise during HAZOP and PSSR.<br /><br />&#x2022; Designed $1MM custom agitators for gravity fed slurry tanks experiencing severe pluggage issues. Worked with vendors providing engineering spec sheets and designed computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models which met our criteria while remaining under budget. Reduced costs by re-using motors (~150k savings), while avoiding critical speed issues (natural harmonic frequency vibration amplification) by tapering the shaft diameter and utilizing rigorous simulation models to ensure sufficient design. Implemented said design during turnaround and measured the improvement in pluggage and reduced downtime as a result, saving the company over $250K/YR.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I'm a lifelong learner always striving to succeed in whatever goals life has in store for me. Apart from being a workaholic, I like to stay active and maintain a somewhat healthy lifestyle to offset all the hours I put in front of a computer. My ability to cook is still a work in progress, but let's just call it passable for now. Also in my free time (I have none) I like to play musical instruments, mainly fingerstyle guitar and the piano.<br /><br />I'm always trying to learn new things and will often assign myself little projects to work on, whether its at home or for work, and thats what ultimately led me to learning more about programming, data analytics, web development, and machine learning. The world is changing and we need to change with it as these technologies ultimately shape our future.</p>
